# LYRC

_a Local lYRic Composer_

LYRC is a web application designed to craft LRC files. The site is in a buggy stage, commits are welcome. but welcome doesn't mean people will fucking do it so it's just me for now

I'll just be entirely transparent - I couldn't be bothered to transfer my idea properly for a lot of hours so I took an idea, **vibecoded** it and refined it a bit. It's still in a lot of errors. If you want to lose your shit, fork this, clone it and try fixing it.

The roadmap is as follows (because my brain is literal mush after the day before I started prooooompting):

- [] Make the waveform view less choppier and more user-friendly
- [] Make the seek bar accurate and not fragile because with enough tweaking while playing it mistimes permanently
- [] make it look better.
- [] figure a better acronym out
